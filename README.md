# Data-Structures-Stack-Queue
This homework is to practice the two Data Structures Stack & Queue
This has nothing to do with the Call Stack and the Event Queue
It's just pure JavaScript

This is a question that you are often asked to implement on a whiteboard

Create a github repo for this and submit the link inside the Populi Assignment

You are going to build 2 classes.
1. A Stack
2. A Queue

You will a separate array for each class  as your stack or queue
The 2 classes have nothing to do with each other.


Stack Class

There must be an array to represent the stack at start and it will initialize empty
Stacks typically are built with the following methods
1) Push method adds to the top of the stack
2) Pop method removes from the top of the stack
3) Peek logs the top element on the stack
4) isEmpty returns true if the stack is empty

Queue Class

There must be an array to represent the queue and it will initialize empty

Queues typically are built with the following methods
1) Enqueue method adds to the back of the queue
2) Dequeue method removes from the front of the queue
3) Front logs the element at the front of the queue
4) isEmpty return true if the queue is empty
5) printQueue returns a string of items in the queue separated by commas


- Don't overthink this. It is as easy as it may appear.
- It doesn't matter which end you consider the top of your stack as long as you are consistent.
